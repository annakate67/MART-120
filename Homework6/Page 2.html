    <h1>Favorite Story</h1>
    <h3>My favorite story is /The Road/ by Cormac McCarthy. It's a 2006<br> 
        sci-fi nuclear-fallout novel that follows two unnamed characters<br> 
        (The Boy and The Man) as they travel to the ocean.<br>
        All living creatures and plants have died in nuclear fallout,<br>
        and most humans have resorted to cannibalism.<br>
        /The Road/ is concerned with hope in the face of despair,<br>
        the question, "What do we owe each other?", and impermanence.<br>
