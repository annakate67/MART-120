The Graphic User Interface (GUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI) are two methods of interacting with an operating system (OS). The GUI is more commonly used by casual computer-users. It displays the interactive parts of an OS graphically— i.e. in the form of windows and icons. One can navigate the GUI by clicking icons, links, and drop-down menus. The graphical reinforcements can make it easier for new and casual computer-users to intuit their way through the system. For example, folders (also called directories) are often signified by icons that resemble physical folders, and text documents often look like pieces of paper.
        The CLI is more often used by people who are very familiar with computers and by people who write code. Rather than using graphics to organize the OS, the CLI uses lines of text. In a command prompt window, the user can type in different commands to pull up and modify information. The files in a particular directory will appear as a list of texts, like sentences. The user can open, rearrange, and edit files and directories using commands. In some ways, typing commands in a CLI can be faster than navigating icons in a GUI. Repetitive steps can also be automated. However, memorizing all the different commands can be difficult and take time, and is less intuitive without graphics to help visualize the process.
